I decided that I should blog under my danmux.com domain - I often use danmux around the internet, sometimes danmull, but normally danmux for tech type things, so it makes sense.

**danmux** because the **x** has always been a notable part of my name - and mux reminds me of my electrical engineering days, and I think humans multiplex all the time, there it is.

## Github Pages

As this will only get a couple of hits what could be better than hosting it on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) - I'm a little bit in love with github anyway so perfect choice.

## Hugo

I'm a little bit in love with go - so [Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com/) was the perfect choice as well, and its been great so far, other than is typical of newish open source projects slightly lacking in the documentation department.
